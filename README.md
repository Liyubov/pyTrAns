# pyTrAns package
PyTrAns (Trajectories Analysis) is python package for trajectories analysis. The package has several modules, which one can use independently from each other for
1. generating or loading trajectories
2. statistical analysis of trajectories (including scaling exponent estimation)
3. classification and post-analysis of trajectories based on analysis modules

As an example we analyse trajectories:

    from random generating processes (generated by stochastic system of equations)
    from real trajectories (from observations) see description and credits in generating_trajectories file



# Usage 
The main functions are generating_trajectories.py, loadng_trajectories and modules for calculation of distributions etc. 
We recommend you to read more about stochastic processes analysis in the papers e.g. here https://sites.google.com/view/fellowshipresultsliubov/research-projects/random-walks-analysis-and-applications?authuser=0


# Credits
While preparing this software some other open packages were used, which are acknoledged in notebooks and code.
(work in progress)
